# icebreaker-altcase
An alternative case for the iCEBreaker FPGA by @esden based on @pimdegroot's design.

# Changes
- Converted all mesh geometry to a set of polylines and a polysurface NURBS model.
- Added a gap in the top part on the case for the Creset header.
- Added additional 2mm rim height on the top part of the case.
- Added additional 1mm rim height on the bottom part of the case.
- Removed redundant geometry on the bottom of the top cover due to increased clearance.
- Added fillets in various corners to remove sharp edges.
- Added a 1BitSquared logo on the top part of the case.
- Added a diagonal hatch pattern on the top and bottom parts of the case.
- Added 0.5 mm clearance for the for M3 nuts on the bottom of the case.

All printing tests were performed on a Creality Ender3, all NURBS modeling is done with Rhino 5.
